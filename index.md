Welcome! I am **Yinyu Yao**, a BS–MS student in Statistics & Operations Research and Mathematics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

My research focuses on:

- Optimization algorithms, especially block-coordinate BFGS methods for convex non-smooth problems  
- Data-driven operations and healthcare operations  
- Machine learning for EMS stroke triage using linked EMS–hospital data  

Currently, I am working on:

- **Block-coordinate BFGS for convex non-smooth optimization** (with Michael O’Neill), comparing quasi-Newton–style block updates to proximal-gradient baselines on large-scale structured problems.  
- **Data-driven EMS stroke triage** (with Ali Parlaktürk, et al.), designing constrained ML decision rules that reduce false negatives for high-risk stroke patients while keeping false positives within operational limits.
