Welcome! I am **Yinyu Yao**, a BS–MS student in Statistics & Operations Research and Mathematics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

My current research focuses on:

- Second-order optimization algorithms for non-smooth problems  
- Data-driven operations and healthcare operations  
- Machine learning for operations 

Currently, I am working on:

## Block-coordinate BFGS for convex non-smooth optimization (with Michael O’Neill)
- Comparing quasi-Newton–style block-coordinate updates to proximal-gradient baselines on large-scale overlapped non-smooth structured problems.
- Manuscript in preparation for submission to *Computational Optimization and Applications* [Manuscript PDF]({{ '/files/Block_BFGS_paper.pdf' | relative_url }})
  
## Data-driven EMS stroke triage (with Ali Parlaktürk, Chudi Zhong)
- Designing constrained ML decision rules that reduce false negatives for high-risk stroke patients while keeping false positives within operational limits.
- Manuscript in preparation
