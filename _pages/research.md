## Manuscripts in preparation

**Block-coordinate BFGS for convex non-smooth optimization** (with Michael O’Neill)  
We develop and analyze a block-coordinate BFGS method for convex non-smooth problems with overlapping group regularizers. The goal is to combine curvature information from quasi-Newton methods with the structure of block-coordinate descent and to compare convergence and empirical performance against proximal-gradient–type baselines on large-scale problems.

_Status: Manuscript in preparation. Draft available [here](/files/Block_BFGS_paper.pdf)._

## Work in progress

**Data-driven EMS stroke triage** (with Ali Parlaktürk, et al.)  
This project uses linked EMS–hospital data to study how constrained classification and machine learning can improve prehospital stroke triage. We focus on reducing false negatives for high-risk stroke patients while keeping false positives within operational limits, and on understanding which EMS fields (chief complaint, neurologic deficits, vascular risk factors) drive triage performance.

_Status: Ongoing work; model development and empirical analysis in progress._
